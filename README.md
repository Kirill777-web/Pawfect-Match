# Pawfect-Match

## Description

Finding a pet can be exciting and a good portion of individuals shop for their next pet to be. That, however, leaves many perfectly lovable animals alone in shelters that are available for adoption. The problem is having an easily accessible platform through which one can find the perfect pet to adopt.

Pawfect Match strives to solve this problem by streamlining the pet adoption process. By providing a comprehensive list of pets available for adoption online, potential pet owners can save themselves the hassle of visiting their local animal shelter.

For this project, the data will be pseudo in nature. In the future in a production style release, different shelters could contact the administrative staff at Pawfect Match to receive an employee account. Through this account, they can then upload animals from their shelter that are available for adoption to the Pawfect Match website for potential owners to view.

# Overview

## Challenge
"You and your group will use everything you’ve learned over the past six weeks to create a real-world full-stack application that you’ll be able to showcase to potential employers. The user story and acceptance criteria will depend on the project that you create, but your project must fulfil the following requirements:

* Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.

* Use Handlebars.js as the templating engine.

* Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.

* Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.

* Be deployed using Heroku (with data).

* Use at least one new library, package, or technology that we haven’t discussed.

* Have a polished UI.

* Be responsive.

* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

* Have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm.

* Include authentication (express-session and cookies).

* Protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.

* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

* Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

* Finally, you must add your project to the portfolio that you created in Module 2."
